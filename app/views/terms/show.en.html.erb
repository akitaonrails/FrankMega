        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">4. No Backup Guarantee</h2>
        <p>Files are stored on a best-effort basis. Once a file expires (by reaching its time limit or maximum download count), it is permanently deleted from the system. No backups are maintained past the expiration period. You are responsible for keeping your own copies of any files you upload.</p>
